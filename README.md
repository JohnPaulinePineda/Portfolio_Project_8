This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_8/) explores various resampling procedures during model hyperparameter tuning and internal validation. Using a Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees model structure, resampling methods applied in the analysis for tuning model hyperparameters and internally validating model performance included K-Fold Cross Validation, Repeated K-Fold Cross Validation, Leave-One-Out Cross Validation, Leave-Group-Out Cross Validation, Bootstrap Validation, Bootstrap 0.632 Validation and Bootstrap with Optimism-Estimation Validation. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models with their respective optimal hyperparameters were evaluated in terms of their classification performance using the accuracy metric, which were subsequently compared to the baseline model's apparent performance values.
